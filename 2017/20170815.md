Social networks
Network analysis 

Eg : predict where next betrayal happens in GoT

Euler graph theory

Networks exist everywhere : offline social networks - MRT, online social network - facebook

Networks are universal - similar network patterns appear in unrelated contexts

Representing networks
Tools : networkx, igraph, graphtools 

Looking for existence and strength of network effects
Representing network data :
1. adjacency matrices (sparse matrix, does not scale well)
2. Adjacency list
3. Edge list - most common way

Node-level attributes : individual characteristics, network-dependent measures like centrality 

Examples : google page rank, linkedin computing influencers.

SN Research 
Unique research challenges 

Speakers favorite research area : peer influence 

Central question in social network analysis : isolating  homophily from influence
