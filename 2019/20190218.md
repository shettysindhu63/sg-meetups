H20 open source -> H20, spark + h20, h204GPU 

Driverless AI  - enterprise software, automated ML, focus on feature engg, visualisation, deployment 
- only has supervised learning for now

The concept behind automated visulisation  
Leland Wilkinson - AutoViz

- Model experimentation - you can experiment with different settings - accuracy, interpretability, time
- AutoML - uses genetic algorithm to select which models to try
- Also uses Klime for machine learning interpretability

Linear models vs machine learning 

- Linear models- exact explanations for approximate models
- Machine learning - approximate explanations for exact models.

Deployment options : AWS lambda, get the scoring pipeline in java/python

Limitations 
- only for tabular data, not for image/video/text
- wont work well for sparse data i.e super wide data with lots of features - the feature engg. part will mess this up as there will be too many combinations 
- wont include some models that are not scalable on GPU
- custom scoring functions not available yet but will be in next 1-2 versions
