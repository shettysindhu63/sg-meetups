Collecting data : public datasets , API, manual labor, scraping - python (if allowed)
 
Clean data : R , SQL, open refine, regex 

Analyse and sketch: R + Illustrator (in R you can export as SVG and refine in illustrator) , Javascript

Polish, code, annotate your visualisation:
Adobe illustrator(ai2html), svg, d3, html/css/js, qgis for mapping  

Points to note 
- sometimes in scraping, webpages already load the dataset as full in javascript file so always check the page source
- responsive because people check on phones
- even if people dont interact at all, they should get most information

A new dawn : case studies 

Fivethirtyeight : news company that uses lot of statistics 

For repetitive plots : generators in d3, go for common plots
