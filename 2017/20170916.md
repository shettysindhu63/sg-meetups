Speaker : Ren Rouxu 

Zendesk - better customer relationships, email platforms, help service, chats - they make software chatbots for customer service 

Without deep learning - need different NLP models for different industries/companies, 
With deep learning (RNN LSTM) - single model for all industries , no feature engineering 

Myths : deep learning deals with noise - No, it requires very clean data, cannot deal with real noise, can only deal with white noise

Comprehension is hard in deep learning : difficult to find what happened

Technical session : she demonstrated a multi-layer perceptron model :  tools - tensorboard, tensorflow, jupyter 

Q : how do you use convnets in text prediction ? - to find the pieces of text that are important like finding region of importance for images in convnets 

- in tensorboard, you can see histograms of weights and find more easily where your learning went wrong while debugging 

Metrics : deflection rate - how many tickets solved by autobots

Speaker : Zane Lim 

Peeking into black-box models: random forest gradient boosting, naive bayed text classification

xgb.to_graphviz() - for visualising the trees

-Partial dependence plot (PDP) : show function response for a particular independent variable by averaging out the effects of all other variables

-LIME : new python package , useful for interpretation , useful to find model sensitivity to different features along with PDP

- this is also good for finding biases in the model

Metrics : for Drank model , they use conversion rate and A/B testing to decide, control group is just assigning the nearest driver
