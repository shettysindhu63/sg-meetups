*Speaker : Christopher Murray, Head of Operations, R2 Data Labs* 

- push towards using more instrumentation and data within the organisation  
- some topics - flight safety, flight knowledge - fuel efficiency, predictive maintainance 
- data storage, warehousing - microsoft azure cloud, pipelines

*Speaker : Minh Nguyen, data scientist, Rolls Royce*<br> 
*Use case: Landing safety analysis*

- this was mostly done for the flight training community to understand what to focus on 
- emphasis on exploratory data to find other possibilities or root causes of recent incidents and prevent future incidents 
- important to communicate with clients that there are certain things that data science can do and cannot depending on the data 

Solution approach 

- extract meaningful features from in-flight signals : domain knowledge, interview pilots 
- cross validation to confirm the imprtance of signals 
- clustering to understand best and worst scenarios 
- check the seasonal or some other groups trend to understand 
for feature importance : linear regression, randomised lasso, random forest - and some ranking 
- but when they discuss with pilots, they say the top features are already known 
- the end goal is not really prediction here but more to find out if there are any emergent risks not already known by pilots 
- takeaway from the analysis - feature importance by altitude - at this altitude : roll, at next altitude : wind etc - this way the pilots can understand 
- no single signal is usually the issue - they always act as a group
- define feature thresholds for hard landings and see which signals are violated together 
- hierarchical clustering used for getting groups that are close to each other and could create problems 
- do the analysis and clustering every month to see how it progresses through time - some clusters may become stronger (measure by some distance metrics) indicating more risk and some clusters may grow weaker 
- then connect this with the domain knowledge and see if any change (like new pilot traning etc) that could explain the change 

*Speaker : Karthik Chidambaram , R2 Data Labs*

joined as data engineer and also works in analytics, machine learning 
Use case : Fuel efficiency 
- fuel account for 40% cost
-challenge : data comes in various formats - cleaning is big challenge 
- dominant feature extraction from more than 1000 signals monitored 
- the take-off and descent phases are challenging to analyse 
 - main takeaways : influence pilot behaviour to take more fuel efficient routes
