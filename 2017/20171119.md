Data science team comes in at business optimisation stage - monitoring and insights should already be in place 

Two core elements in data science : data and problem (not models)

Projects in shopee : spam detection, project categary suggestion, fraud detection, targeted marketing, recommendation

Also stressed on setting a suitable KPI, model explanation or interpretation, offline model may not work online very well - need to understand how much accuracy is practical 

For recommendation - they use spark ml as the dataset very huge 

Difference between industry and academia
- data is huge and noisy
- deadlines is clearer
- communication more important, explain to layman the model and convince them this can work 
- most suitable approach more important than novel approach 

Pain point for data scientists - person building the model and person building the system is different 
- Pros is everyone is doing what they know best but cons is huge communication cost 
- Industries are looking for solutions for these - like data scientists write production code , write modular blocks etc. 

Value of data scientist
- feature engineering is 80 % of the work 
- for image, text, voice - deep learning can do feature engineering .... but apart from these 3 areas, you have to do feature engineerng yourself, domain knowledge is still important
