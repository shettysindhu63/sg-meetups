**Speaker : Too many**

*Speaker 1: Paco Nathan (O’Reilly Media)*<br>
*Topic 1: PyTextRank: Graph algorithms for enhanced natural language processing*

- Open source, used in production - PyTextRank
- Use case : machine learning apps for media 
- Knowledge graph for categorizing contents 
- When u search say for tensorflow in o'rielly, it returns few hits (partly generated + curated by humans + AI) - the summarization of chapters is done by machine learning 
- Bag-of-words dont work very well in this case 

Basically his talk was about how to do this summarization by graph analysis 
Github repo - pytextrank 

Why he is doing this instead of just using off the shelf NLP packages - so that he can use the already existing knowledge graph if u use a graph analysis approach

*Speaker 3: Ted Malaska (Blizzard)*<br>
*Topic 3: Considerations for Data at Speed*

Considerations 
- have a schema (strongly typed) for every data ingested , everything needs to be structured 
- for GDPR, users can access what data is stored by them anytime, ask to delete their data and know what exactly you are doing with their data
- no code, interacing with data sources should be like web clicking 
- all data is tagged for full tracability of data, which location it came from, which tables are associated with it
- pick the right data source for your problem - most of your problems go away - dont stick to one tool
- time series databases are great for this it seems - ennity, metric
- machine learning on customer profile data 
- monitor, debug , protect - protect the pipelines 
- data modelling requires communication 
- tagging : put metadata on ur schemas so you can search based on these tags to get the meaning and context in which these schemas 
- understand and use nested structures like json

Speaker 4:  Wolff Dobson (Google)
Topic 4: art and machine learning 

Tensorflow eager : execute directly from python , removes boilerplate code 

Tensorflow lite : run on mobile devices 

Google magenta - open source project - intersection btwn art and ML - generating music, images, text - jokes, narratives 

Generative models of media 
- interestingness/surprise 
- how to measure sucess
- some structure required 

Generative adversial networks 
- Google brain - counterpoint convolution - bach music 
- Performance RNN - large dataset from yamaha music contest - has structure and sound pleasant 
- Visual media - style transfer for photos and videos 
- SketchRNN - drawing, abstractions - trained on quickdraw dataset - they made a game to collect labeled dataset 
- Neural photo editing - make ur own game character
- Blog : magenta.tensorflow.org , there r docker images

*Speaker 5: Deep Learning on Anonymized Datasets*<br>
*Topic 5:  Yufeng Guo (developer advocate, Google)*

Dataset : criteo click data : open data - whle set is about 1 TB, smaller set about 5GB

Task : predict whether an ad was clicked on based on 39 anonymised features i.e column have no name and values have no meaning

Wide and deep model : numerical columns good for deep learning, categorical columns good for linear models (wide)

- anonymised datasets will become more common in future 
- he also talked about tensorboard - also works with tensorflow canned estimators (so u dont have to write the whole tensorflow code)
- google cloud machine learning engine - will figure out the scaling part for u- how many gpus u need etc if you supply the tensorflow code - can also serve/deploy- u have a model serving with rest api 
- he has a video channel - google cloud AI adventures

*Speaker 6: Jared P. Lander (Lander Analytics)*<br>
*Topic 6:  R for Everything* 

- Make directories with R - dir.create, dir.exists
- Download - download.file, curl 
- xkcd comics - getXKCD
- Untar the file - untar
- Delete the file - unlink , file.remove 
- file.inspect
- Commit to git, gmailr
- R also has bookdown and blogdown
