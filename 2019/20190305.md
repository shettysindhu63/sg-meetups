**Group : DataX Singapore**

**Topic : Topics from Day 1**

**Tags : data science, machine learning, AI**

*Speaker: Derek Chan (IBM) *<br>
*Topic: Delivering Successful AI Projects*

- Immerse into your stakeholder's world (customised dashboards, report etc)
- Define different types of end-users (and use specific storytelling)
- Sprints: get feedback, iterate, establish the baseline first 
- Start with augmented intelligence: supplements the end-users' productivity, not marginalise them

*Speaker: Janet Uy (Oracle) *<br>
*Topic: Having a sound data strategy to run successful AI Projects*

Data Science Lifecycle 
Aggreate -> Manage -> Experiment & Testing -> Analyse and Act

Cold-start problem: No data -> no ML in product
How to start then: data-drive culture, data strategy 

Hurdles to AI adoption 
- Access and manage data 
- Missing skill sets
- Disparate technologies 

Build a data lab, don't build data products in silos

*Speaker: Alex Hoehl (Denodo Technologies) *<br>
*Topic: On Data virtualisation*

Data infrastructure (server/cloud) -> data virtualisation (abstract layer) -> data consumers (R, Tableau etc)

One of the strong features of Denodo : data security

All metadata/data catalogue available immediately 

- Denodo use case: AutoDesk (integration of streaming data)
- Aggregated push down : push down as much to the data source so you have less unnecessary data transfer to the data consumers 
- Single purpose to multi-purpose database: for different end-users 

More traditional way is to use ETL, but this can be slow. Faster approach is to use data virtualization as a data-delivery method. 

Using Denodo: mostly GUI or SQL-based

*Speaker: Eugene Yan (UCARE.AI) *<br>
*Topic: Better understand patients and predict hospital costs*

Feature engineering, machine learning, deployment 

- ML: emperical experimentation, Feature selection, parameter tunining, data weightings 

1. More data or more features != Better models 
2. Talk to users/domain experts 
3. Follow propoer engineering practices (DevOps, version control, build-release cycles, unit testing, CI/CD)

Data quality is a challenge 

Building useful data products is a team effort 

- Don't assume anything of the data 
- ML is less than 20% of effort, methodology/engg. practices more important
