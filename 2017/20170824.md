Speaker : Zane Lim 

Gojek started with transport but expanded to logistics, food delivery, payment and other on demand services 

- intro
- arcitecture , where the algorithm DRank is deployed
- business questions

Reframed the problem as binary classification on whether the driver completed the job or not

Modeling methodology : split by time - training, validation and evaluation period . Start from today and look backwards. Retrain daily. 

Split by time to avoid data leakage: you dont accidently use some future variable

XGBoost (gradient boosting) model : libraries available in many languages , easy to deploy

Key : minimal hyperparameter tuning, more time spent on features engineering and daily retraining

Interpretability important in business problems : black box models are not accepted

Deployment in production

Automated deployment - started everyday - few manual checks and then just click button to deploy

Load testing : simulate peak hours and monitor latency

Monitoring : datadog, newrelic , stackdriver

- Food Recommendation 

Recommender systems - logistic regression, collabarative filtering, wide and deep model ( open sourced by google TFlearn API )

Wide - memorise item pairs 
Deep - generalize to new item pairs 

Improve the diversity of recommendations - "surprise me" 

- Time Series forecast

Recurrent neural network : LSTM 

Training process : randomly shuffle time split data

Then do inference

EMA : exponential moving average - use EMA of weights for inference - this made the model more stable

- Fraud detection system
Graph models
Deep encoder
RBM 

Encoder : Using reconstruction error as fraud score 

In RBM : instead of using deterministic (like encoder) units, use stochastoc units with gaussian or bernoulli distributions

In RBM - more often use free energy as fraud score : higher the free energy, higher the chances of fraud 

Real dataset : kaggle dalpozz creditcardfraud

The free energy distribution looks very different for fraud and non-fraud cases : find a threshold based on your metrics 

Takeways

- Features are critical 
- Precision and recall 
- Normalize your data
